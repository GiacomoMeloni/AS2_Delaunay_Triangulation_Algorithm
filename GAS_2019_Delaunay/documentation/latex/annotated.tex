\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classDagNode}{Dag\+Node} \\*Class representing a D\+AG node. A D\+AG node contain the index of the triangle in the array of the relative delauney triangulation class; a list of \hyperlink{classDagNode}{Dag\+Node} pointers to childrens; a list of \hyperlink{classDagNode}{Dag\+Node} pointers to the adjacent triangles that is updated every time something happens to the triangulation }{\pageref{classDagNode}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classDelaunayTriangulationAlgorithm}{Delaunay\+Triangulation\+Algorithm} \\*Class that manage the Delaunay Triangulation. The aim of this class is to build and fill all the data structures that rappresenting the triangulation. This class contains a vector of triangles that collect all that triangles made by splits; a dag node pointer used to build the D\+AG structure starting from the root (the bounding triangle); a vector of dag\+Node pointer that collect all the created pointer of the D\+AG (this is made to manage the cancellation of the dag and the construction of the voronoi diagram) }{\pageref{classDelaunayTriangulationAlgorithm}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classTriangle}{Triangle} \\*Class representing a 2D \hyperlink{classTriangle}{Triangle}. The triangle is rappresented by three vertices. The vertices order is counter-\/clockwise }{\pageref{classTriangle}}{}
