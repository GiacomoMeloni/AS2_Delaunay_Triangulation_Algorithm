Class that manage the Delaunay Triangulation. The aim of this class is to build and fill all the data structures that rappresenting the triangulation. This class contains a vector of triangles that collect all that triangles made by splits; a dag node pointer used to build the D\+AG structure starting from the root (the bounding triangle); a vector of dag\+Node pointer that collect all the created pointer of the D\+AG (this is made to manage the cancellation of the dag and the construction of the voronoi diagram)
